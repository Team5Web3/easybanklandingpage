Hi, Everyone.

This is yet another Frontend Design Project intended to sharpen our skills in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the Web 3.0, carried out by the members of Team 5 in a budding Web 3.0 Community on Discord.

The actual project we were assigned to recreate is located in the Design Folder - both desktop and mobile versions.

Our attempted work is open to corrections and feedback; it is the index.html file, while the mobile version can be viewed by testing the responsiveness through resizing.

Participants in this work according to their Github Links are as follows;

1. https://github.com/goonerlabs
2. https://github.com/Favytechs
3. https://github.com/Eceegit
4. https://github.com/Meauma13


Some challenges encountered and learning insights gained during the course of this project include;

1.Centering Bootstrap cards horizontally by using 
<code>
  .card {
        width: 20rem; /* width can vary depending on your need */
        margin: 0 auto;
        float: none;
    }
</code>

2. Realizing that placing an SVG background image for a div inside a parent div container will help to move the svg file when the browser window is resized. Though, still subject to some limitations.


Further Learning Goals

1. How to resize an SVG image as the browser window resizes.
2. How to space Bootstrap cards during resizing
